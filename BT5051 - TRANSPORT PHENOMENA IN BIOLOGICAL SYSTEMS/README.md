BT5051 - Transport Phenomena in Biological Systems

* Covered mass, momentum, heat and charge transport using fundamental conservation laws and constitutive relations, employing integrated models to characterize coupled-flux behavior in excitable membranes, blood-gas exchange units, and other biologically relevant transport interfaces.
* For the course project, I performed a detailed transport-phenomena analysis of Mega Blastoise’s Hydro Pump by modeling the carapace as an ellipsoid and the plastron as a shallow circular segment, using quadratic approximations to compute the internal water volume available for discharge. The resulting high-velocity jet was treated as fully turbulent flow, characterized using Reynolds-number. Momentum and energy balances were then applied to quantify internal cannon pressure, jet velocity, energetic requirements, and the corresponding recoil forces imparted to the organism. Finally, the expected mechanical impact on the opposing Pokémon was estimated by modeling momentum transfer and drag-mediated deceleration during jet contact, providing a complete mechanical assessment of the attack’s effectiveness.

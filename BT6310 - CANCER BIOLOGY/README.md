BT6310 - Cancer Biology

* Covered the molecular basis of cancer, examining oncogene activation, loss of tumor-suppressor control, dysregulation of signaling pathways, metabolic reprogramming, mechanisms enabling invasion and metastasis, and the rationale underlying targeted and immune-modulatory therapeutic strategies.
* For the assignment, I performed a comprehensive literature review on nanotechnology-based cancer detection and therapy, detailing nanoparticle-enabled imaging modalities, circulating tumor cell (CTC) detection and isolation, nanoparticle-mediated hyperthermia for localized tumor ablation, and an assessment of manufacturing, pharmacokinetic and regulatory challenges in nanomedicine deployment.

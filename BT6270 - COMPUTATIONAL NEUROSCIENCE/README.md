BT6270 - Computational Neuroscience

* Assignment 1 entailed simulating Hodgkin-Huxley neurons, classifying their firing regimes (no-AP, finite-AP, continuous, distorted firing regimes) and quantifing frequency response to different input currents.
* Assignment 2 entailed analysing FitzHugh-Nagumo neuronal model dynamics, performing fixed-point classification and mapping excitability, oscillations, depolarization, and bistability using τ-Δ analysis.
* Assignment 3 entailed implementing complex coupling and and power coupling of Hopf oscillators, achieving constant phase difference and normalized phase difference for neural-oscillator synchronization, which enables phase-based memory encoding in oscillator networks.

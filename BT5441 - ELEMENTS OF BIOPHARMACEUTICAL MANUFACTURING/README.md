BT5441 - Elements of Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing

* Assignment 1 entailed reviewing contemporary literature on strategies to overcome secretory-pathway bottlenecks in CHO cells for enhanced recombinant FVIII productivity, organizing and ranking approaches by effectiveness, and proposing multiplexed combinations to maximize product yield.
* Assignment 2 entailed performing spent-media analysis on CHO batch-culture data and applying principal component analysis to quantify metabolite influences on specific growth rate and productivity (for both clones), enabling identification of the optimal clone-media combination.
* The term project involved investigating the impact of LDHa + PDK-1/2 knockout on CHO-S cultures with a primary focus on specific growth rate. We integrated spent-media profiling, multivariate data analysis, flux balance analysis and transcriptomic characterization to identify affected pathways and quantify the metabolic shifts due to the knockout.

Setting: The Simpson family is sitting in the living room, discussing weekend plans. The TV is on, showing a video game commercial, and the smell of Marge's baking wafts through the air.

Bart slouches on the couch, controller in hand, eyes glued to the screen.

Bart: I want to play games.

Homer, lounging in his chair with a donut, looks up with a raised eyebrow.

Homer: Games? What about reading something educational?

Bart rolls his eyes dramatically.

Bart: I do not want to read Hamlet.

Lisa, sitting cross-legged on the floor with a book in her lap, chimes in with enthusiasm.

Lisa: But it's a classic! You might learn something.

Bart gestures wildly, throwing his hands in the air.

Bart: I want you to go away!

Marge, bustling around the kitchen, overhears the commotion and peeks in.

Marge: Bart, you need to be nice to your sister.

Bart crosses his arms, looking defiant.

Bart: You want me to suffer!

Homer chuckles, trying to lighten the mood.

Homer: Bart, don't be so dramatic. It's just a play!

Bart slumps back into the couch, exasperated.

Bart: My whole life is a lie.

Lisa raises an eyebrow, intrigued.

Lisa: What are you talking about?

Bart sits up straight, a mischievous grin on his face.

Bart: My name is Lance Ambu.

Marge frowns, trying to understand.

Marge: Lance Ambu? Is that a new character you made up?

Bart shakes his head, still grinning.

Bart: I do not have it!

Homer leans forward, curious.

Homer: Do you mean you don't have a cool name like Lance Ambu?

Bart puffs out his chest with pride.

Bart: My name is Bart.

Lisa smiles and nods.

Lisa: Well, Bart is a pretty cool name too!

Bart flips his hair back, feeling confident.

Bart: My haircut is awesome!

Marge smiles lovingly from the kitchen.

Marge: Yes, Bart, your haircut is unique!

Homer laughs and points at the TV.

Homer: Let's just order some pizza and play video games instead.

Bart jumps up from the couch, excited.

Bart: Now you're talking!

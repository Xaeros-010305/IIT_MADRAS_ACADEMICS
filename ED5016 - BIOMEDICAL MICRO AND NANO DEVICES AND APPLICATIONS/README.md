ED5016 - Biomedical Micro/Nano Devices and Applications

* Assignment 4 - Designed a high-throughput single-cell photoporation platform by fabricating SU-8 stencils on Si, creating micro-etched trapping wells, and integrating spiky-gold-nanoparticle-coated glass for plasmonic heating, enabling controlled single-cell membrane poration and drug diffusion.
* Assignment 5 - Designed a hybrid opto-electroporation microfluidic device by patterning ITO electrodes, fabricating SU-8 single-cell traps, and integrating TiO₂ photothermal rings, allowing for light-induced poration and low-voltage electroporation to achieve efficient, high-viability single-cell drug delivery.
* Designed a hybrid mechanoporation and nano-electroporation device, for the course project, incorporating microfluidic constriction zones for mechanoporation, quake-style pneumatic microvalves for real-time single-cell isolation, and ITO electrodes for nanolocalized electric-field delivery; ensuring high cell viability, robust transfection efficiency across diverse cell types, and scalable high-throughput parallel operation.
